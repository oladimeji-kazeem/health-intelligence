# AI-Ready Health Data Platform  
*A synthetic, secure, and explainable NHS-style data ecosystem for population health innovation*

---

### 🚀 Overview
The **AI-Ready Health Data Platform** is a *mini “Health Innovation Manchester”–style ecosystem* that demonstrates how synthetic health data, ethical AI, and secure data-sharing principles can converge to deliver better patient outcomes and research insights.

It showcases:
- Unified **data ingestion and interoperability** (FHIR-like schema)
- **AI-ready pipelines** across synthetic NHS datasets
- **Secure Data Environment (SDE)** design — governance, audit, and consent
- **Predictive analytics** (readmission risk, chronic disease detection)
- **Explainable AI** dashboards for transparency and trust

> ⚡ *Built end-to-end by **Oladimeji Kazeem**, to illustrate digital and data leadership capability for transforming care models through AI, data, and innovation.*
